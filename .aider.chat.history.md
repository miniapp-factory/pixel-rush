```
Create a clean and simple 2D pixel-style game using only built-in browser capabilities and no external dependencies. Include smooth player movement, obstacles or enemies, a scoring system, and progressive difficulty. Generate all game assets inside the project: pixel sprites, tiles, backgrounds, animations, UI icons, and basic sound effects. Organize everything into folders for assets, scripts, and scenes.

When the player completes the final level, show a dedicated Congratulations Screen containing:
• A large animated “CONGRATULATIONS!” message
• Final score
• Best performance stats (highest combo, fastest clear time, accuracy, or similar depending on gameplay)
• A short text summary highlighting the player’s strongest skill
• Buttons for replay, leaderboard, and return to menu

Add a local Leaderboard System (no internet required). Store and display:
• Player name
• Score
• Clear time
• Best stat
• Rank position
Highlight the player’s new rank and show a “New Personal Best!” animation when applicable.

Include standard UI screens using built-in elements: Main Menu, How to Play, Settings, Pause, Game Over, Leaderboard, and Congratulations.

Keep everything fully self-contained, lightweight, and runnable without the internet. Make the overall experience polished, competitive, and visually engaging while staying within simple 2D constraints.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The following files are the most likely candidates that will need to be edited to implement the requested game and update the app logo/metadata:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to change the title, description, and logo URL.
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate a new logo image for the app.

If you want to add the actual game logic and UI screens, you’ll also need to edit or create files under `mini-app/app/`, `mini-app/components/`, and `mini-app/public/` (e.g., `mini-app/public/game-assets/`, `mini-app/components/game.tsx`, etc.).  

Please add the files you want to modify to the chat, and I’ll provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
