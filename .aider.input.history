+Create a clean and simple 2D pixel-style game using only built-in browser capabilities and no external dependencies.

+When the player completes the final level, show a dedicated Congratulations Screen containing:
+• A large animated “CONGRATULATIONS!” message
+• Final score
+• Best performance stats (highest combo, fastest clear time, accuracy, or similar depending on gameplay)
+• A short text summary highlighting the player’s strongest skill
+• Buttons for replay, leaderboard, and return to menu
+
+Add a local Leaderboard System (no internet required). Store and display:
+• Player name
+• Score
+• Clear time
+• Best stat
+• Rank position
+Highlight the player’s new rank and show a “New Personal Best!” animation when applicable.
+
+Include standard UI screens using built-in elements: Main Menu, How to Play, Settings, Pause, Game Over, Leaderboard, and Congratulations.
+
+Keep everything fully self-contained, lightweight, and runnable without the internet. Make the overall experience polished, competitive, and visually engaging while staying within simple 2D constraints.
