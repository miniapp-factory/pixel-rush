+Create a clean and simple 2D pixel-style game using only built-in browser capabilities and no external dependencies. Include smooth player movement, obstacles or enemies, a scoring system, and progressive difficulty. Generate all game assets inside the project: pixel sprites, tiles, backgrounds, animations, UI icons, and basic sound effects. Organize everything into folders for assets, scripts, and scenes.
+
+When the player completes the final level, show a dedicated Congratulations Screen containing:
+• A large animated “CONGRATULATIONS!” message
+• Final score
+• Best performance stats (highest combo, fastest clear time, accuracy, or similar depending on gameplay)
+• A short text summary highlighting the player’s strongest skill
+• Buttons for replay, leaderboard, and return to menu
+
+Add a local Leaderboard System (no internet required). Store and display:
+• Player name
+• Score
+• Clear time
+• Best stat
+• Rank position
+Highlight the player’s new rank and show a “New Personal Best!” animation when applicable.
+
+Include standard UI screens using built-in elements: Main Menu, How to Play, Settings, Pause, Game Over, Leaderboard, and Congratulations.

+- Gameplay: objects (coins / figurines) fall or appear randomly on a grid/field. Players can drag or move coins to merge identical coins (e.g. two Bitcoin → next‑tier coin or higher score).  
+- The coins/figurines are crypto-themed: include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Honeytoken, “Memecoin”, each as distinct coin sprites.  
+- On merge: coins should combine visually and upgrade (or disappear + increase score) — like a merge‑puzzle mechanic.  
+- Controls: allow touch (mobile) and mouse/keyboard (desktop).  
+- Visuals: show coin sprites clearly; grid or field background; simple UI for score.  
+- Features: scoring system, maybe timer or progressively more coins appearing; feedback on merges; ability to restart.  
+- No external libraries — use browser‑native HTML5/canvas/JS (or whichever engine OpenxAI uses internally).  
+- Keep the game simple but playable: focus on coin‑merge mechanic, visual clarity, and interactivity.
